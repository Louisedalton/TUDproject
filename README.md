Gender Representation in Education and Government: A Thirty-One Year Analysis 
Datasets containing records on the ratio of girls to boys in education from 1985-2016 and the percentage of women in national parliaments from 1990-2017 were retrieved from UN Data.

Each dataset was preprocessed using R-Studio and a time series analysis of each dataset was created on a global level and on a regional level. Regional is defined here using pre-defined regions as per the data sets â€“ Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Asia, South-eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Western Asia, Europe and Oceania. The data was also analysed on a national level for Libya, Rwanda, Bolivia, Cuba, Japan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, India, USA, Australia and Ireland.

The purpose of the analysis was the examination of general trends in the percentage of parliamentary seats held by women, on a global, regional and national level; the examination of general trends in the ratio of boys to girls in education on a global, regional and national level; and the examination of any correlation between these data sets.

No clear correlation between these datasets was found, with Rwanda, which has the highest percentage of women members in their national parliament, actually having a less than 1:1 ratio of girls to boys in education overall and specifically at tertiary level. It became clear that other factors heavily influence the gender ratio both in national parliaments and in education, and all of these factors need to be considered when considering how to improve gender ratios at a government level.
